      <description>2 weeks ago, I had the chance to assist to FSE&amp;rsquo;19 in Talling to present the final paper of my thesis titled: &amp;ldquo;The Importance of Accounting for Real-World Labelling When Predicting Software Vulnerabilities&amp;rdquo;, which was awarded with a  Distinguished Paper Award .
The paper presents the risks faced when using temporal data to train and evaluate Vulnerability Prediction Models(VPM).
The paper can be found here.</description>

      <description>Following the acceptance of my paper &amp;ldquo;On the Impact of Tokenizer and Parameters on N-Gram Based Code Analysis&amp;rdquo; at ICSME this year, the publication as well as the project section have been updated. Among the two added projects, tuna is the artefact going along with the paper. It contains different utilities such as tokenizer, nGram Model library, defect dataset generator tool as well as the code to reproduce the experiments. While the second added project called data7 corresponds to the refactored version of the vulnerability dataset generator tool used in my previous paper.</description>
