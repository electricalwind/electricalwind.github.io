During my Ph.D., my research mainly focused on _the analysis_ and _automated detection_ of Software Vulnerabilities. In this context, I developped several tools to automatically collect data on Software vulnerabilities and replicate existing approaches. I am now investigating various ways to improve the detection and better understand software vulnerabilities.


## Vulnerability Prediction Modeling

Vulnerability Preidiction Modelling has been the central element of my PhD and is still the main focus of my research. The idea of Vulnerability Prediction Modelling is to guide the code review process by ordering the software components to investigate according to their likelihood of being vulnerable. Such ordering is traditionnaly performed by a trained machine learning model. A traditional axis of research usually consist in finding interesting feature sets that correlate with the likelihood of a vulnerability and could thus be used to train a model. More recently, research shifted to the investigation of the use of Deep learning techniques to create those models. I'm currently refactoring my software vulnerability gathering framework called _Data7_ to enable further experiments.
