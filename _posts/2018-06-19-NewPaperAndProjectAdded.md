Following the acceptance of my paper "On the Impact of Tokenizer and Parameters on N-Gram Based Code Analysis" at ICSME this year, the publication as well as the project section have been updated. Among the two added projects, [tuna](http://www.jimenez.lu/tuna) is the artefact going along with the paper. It contains different utilities such as tokenizer, nGram Model library, defect dataset generator tool as well as the code to reproduce the experiments. While the second added project called [data7](http://www.jimenez.lu/data7) corresponds to the refactored version of the vulnerability dataset generator tool used in my previous paper.
